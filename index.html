 <h3>In Fact...</h3>
    	<img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/af/0b/79/af0b7939f5bd192f316fd44099cafca9.jpg" alt="Chart comparing meal costs">
    	<p>Many animal byproducts, such as cheese, milk, eggs, and fish are among the most costly!</p>
    	<p>Just think about how much the average person spends on not only animal byproducts, but also things that are not fit for a healthy lifestyle</p>
    <h3>Things like...</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>Chips</li>
    	<li>Soda</li>
    	<li>Takeout</li>
    	<li>Milk Chocolate and candies</li>
    	<li>Processed snacks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you still think eating unhealthy is cheaper, then take a look at this:</p>

		In response to <a href="http://www.ilovevegan.com/resources/vegan-lifestyle-on-a-budget/">Vegan lifestyle on a Budget</a>. The HTML in this site's index page, found under the developer tools sources tab, became recognizable to me after completing a bit of HTML myself. Specifically, the layout of the HTML: head, title, and body. I can only assume what some of these elements do, since I haven't seen them before. Specifically, the script tag that's followed by a function. I'm assuming that this will create some sort of action on the screen, maybe a click. But I can't be certain. I think this website is successful because the layout is clean and simple, light and the chosen graphics are of great quality and integrated nicely.
